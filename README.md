## About Me

Hi everyone! My name is Kevin Boyle and I am currently in my last semester at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. I like to work on all parts of full stack applications, and some of my favorite languages include Python, C/C++, and Go (not to mention Markdown).

## My Repositories

Most of the repositories on my GitHub are forks of other repositories used for school, but I have a personal project [ResuMake](https://github.com/kevinb5617/ResuMake) which I started in this last semester of school, with the goal of making a personal website.
